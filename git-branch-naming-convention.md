# Git Branch Naming Conventions

If you decide not to use separate `dev` and `release` branches, you can still effectively manage and group Pull Requests (PRs) by adopting a clear and consistent branch naming convention. This approach allows you to maintain a streamlined branching strategy while still organizing work in a way that supports collaboration and efficient code management.

Idea is to skip the PR merge flow for `dev` branch and recommended to use branches with specific prefix. This is called as `**GitHub Flow**`.

### Branch Naming Conventions for PR Grouping

In this approach, you use specific prefixes and descriptive names for your branches to indicate the purpose and context of the work being done. This helps in easily identifying and grouping related PRs, even without the separate `dev` or `release` branches.

Here’s a suggested naming convention:

1. **Feature Branches**:
   - **Prefix**: `feature/`
   - **Structure**: `feature/brief-description`
   - **Example**: `feature/user-authentication`
   - **Purpose**: These branches are for new features or enhancements. The name should briefly describe the feature being implemented.

2. **Bugfix Branches**:
   - **Prefix**: `bugfix/`
   - **Structure**: `bugfix/issue-id-brief-description`
   - **Example**: `bugfix/1234-login-error`
   - **Purpose**: These branches are for fixing bugs. Including the issue ID helps in tracking the bug in your issue tracker.

3. **Hotfix Branches**:
   - **Prefix**: `hotfix/`
   - **Structure**: `hotfix/urgent-issue-description`
   - **Example**: `hotfix/critical-security-patch`
   - **Purpose**: These are for urgent fixes that need to go directly into production. They are typically merged into the `main` branch and then deployed immediately.

4. **Experimental Branches**:
   - **Prefix**: `experiment/`
   - **Structure**: `experiment/description`
   - **Example**: `experiment/new-ui-layout`
   - **Purpose**: These branches are used for exploratory work or prototyping. They may or may not be merged into the `main` branch, depending on the outcome of the experiment.

5. **Task Branches**:
   - **Prefix**: `task/`
   - **Structure**: `task/brief-description`
   - **Example**: `task/code-refactoring`
   - **Purpose**: These branches are for general tasks that don’t necessarily introduce new features or fix bugs, such as refactoring code or updating documentation.

6. **Release Branches** (if occasionally needed):
   - **Prefix**: `release/`
   - **Structure**: `release/version-number`
   - **Example**: `release/v1.0.0`
   - **Purpose**: Even if you don’t normally use a dedicated release branch, having a temporary release branch can be useful for final testing and last-minute fixes.

### PR Grouping with Labels

In addition to branch naming conventions, using labels to group and categorize PRs can be very effective:

- **Feature Labels**: Apply labels like `feature`, `enhancement`, or `new-feature` to PRs that introduce new functionality.
- **Bugfix Labels**: Use `bugfix`, `bug`, or `fix` labels for PRs that address issues.
- **Hotfix Labels**: Mark urgent fixes with a `hotfix` label.
- **Task Labels**: Use labels such as `task`, `maintenance`, or `refactor` for non-feature work.
- **Release Labels**: If a branch is part of a specific release, you can apply a label like `release-v1.0.0`.

### Example Workflow

1. **Starting Work**:
   - Developer A starts working on a new authentication feature. They create a branch named `feature/user-authentication`.
   - Developer B fixes a bug related to login errors. They create a branch named `bugfix/1234-login-error`.

2. **Opening PRs**:
   - Developer A opens a PR with the title "Implement User Authentication" from the branch `feature/user-authentication`. They add labels `feature` and `v1.2.0` (if it’s part of a specific release).
   - Developer B opens a PR titled "Fix Login Error (Issue #1234)" from `bugfix/1234-login-error` and adds the label `bugfix`.

3. **Reviewing and Merging**:
   - PRs are reviewed and, once approved, merged into the `main` branch.
   - If a release is imminent, you can group all relevant PRs using a shared label (e.g., `v1.2.0`) to track which changes are included in the release.

### Advantages of This Approach

- **Simplicity**: You avoid the overhead of managing multiple long-lived branches like `dev` or `release`, keeping the workflow straightforward.
- **Clarity**: The branch names and labels clearly communicate the purpose of each branch, making it easy to track and group related work.
- **Flexibility**: This approach works well in both small and large teams, allowing developers to work independently while still maintaining an organized codebase.

### Conclusion

By adopting clear and descriptive branch naming conventions, along with a strategic use of PR labels, you can efficiently manage and group code changes without the need for separate `dev` or `release` branches. This approach is particularly well-suited for teams looking to simplify their Git workflows while maintaining effective collaboration and code organization.

## Git Branching approach for team with junior developers

When working with a developer crowd that includes newbies, it's important to adopt a branching and release strategy that balances simplicity, guidance, and safety. The goal is to ensure that new developers can contribute effectively without feeling overwhelmed, while also maintaining a clean, stable codebase. Here’s an approach that can help achieve these goals:

### 1. **Adopt a Simplified Git Workflow**

A simplified workflow helps new developers understand the process without getting lost in complex branching strategies. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

#### **Main Branch (`main` or `master`)**:
- **Purpose**: This branch always reflects the stable, production-ready code. It should be protected, meaning that direct pushes are not allowed, and changes can only be made through Pull Requests (PRs).
  
#### **Feature Branches**:
- **Naming Convention**: Use a simple and descriptive naming convention for feature branches, such as `feature/brief-description`. This makes it easy for everyone to understand what the branch is for.
- **Creation**: Developers create a new feature branch from the `main` branch for each new feature or bug fix.
- **Example**: `feature/add-login-page`, `bugfix/fix-logout-error`.

#### **Pull Request Process**:
- **Guidance**: Provide a clear, step-by-step guide on how to open a PR, including writing a meaningful title and description, linking to any related issues, and adding relevant labels.
- **Code Reviews**: Implement mandatory code reviews for all PRs. This not only maintains code quality but also serves as a learning opportunity for new developers.
- **Automated Tests**: Integrate automated testing into the PR process. This helps catch issues early and teaches new developers the importance of testing.

#### **Merging**:
- **Use Squash and Merge**: To keep the commit history clean, use the “Squash and Merge” option when merging PRs into `main`. This combines all commits from the feature branch into a single commit, making the history easier to read.
- **Merge Requirements**: Set up branch protection rules so that a PR can only be merged if it passes all tests and has been approved by at least one senior developer.

### 2. **Guidance and Documentation**

#### **Documentation**:
- **Onboarding Guide**: Create a detailed onboarding guide that explains the Git workflow, branching strategy, and PR process. Include screenshots and examples to make it accessible.
- **Best Practices**: Document best practices for writing commit messages, handling conflicts, and managing branches.

#### **Mentorship**:
- **Buddy System**: Pair new developers with more experienced team members who can mentor them through their first few PRs.
- **Code Reviews as Learning**: Encourage experienced developers to use code reviews as a teaching tool, explaining not just what changes to make, but why.

### 3. **Automated Tools and Checks**

#### **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
- **Automated Testing**: Set up a CI pipeline that automatically runs tests when a PR is opened or updated. This helps catch issues early and reinforces the importance of testing.
- **Linting and Formatting**: Integrate linting and formatting tools (like ESLint, Prettier) into the CI process to ensure code consistency. This reduces the need for nitpicky code review comments and helps new developers learn good coding practices.

#### **Branch Protection Rules**:
- **Enforce PR Reviews**: Set branch protection rules so that code cannot be merged into `main` without an approved PR.
- **Require Passing Checks**: Ensure that all CI checks (tests, linting) must pass before a PR can be merged.

### 4. **Simple Branch Naming and Grouping**

- **Branch Naming**: Keep branch names short and descriptive. Avoid overly complex or technical names that might confuse new developers.
  - **Example**: `feature/add-profile-page`, `bugfix/correct-typo-in-footer`.
  
- **PR Grouping with Labels**: Use simple labels to categorize PRs, like `feature`, `bugfix`, `documentation`, etc. This helps in organizing work and makes it easier for newbies to understand the purpose of different PRs.

### 5. **Feedback and Continuous Improvement**

#### **Regular Check-Ins**:
- **Team Meetings**: Hold regular team meetings to discuss the Git workflow and gather feedback. Encourage new developers to share their experiences and challenges.
- **Retrospectives**: After each sprint or major release, conduct a retrospective to discuss what worked well and what could be improved in the workflow.

#### **Iterative Improvement**:
- **Adapt Based on Feedback**: Continuously refine the branching strategy and PR process based on feedback from the team, particularly new developers.
- **Simplify Where Possible**: If certain aspects of the workflow are consistently challenging for new developers, consider simplifying them.

### Conclusion

For a developer crowd with newbies, the best approach is a simplified and well-documented Git workflow that emphasizes guidance, mentorship, and automated checks. By adopting a straightforward branching strategy, providing clear documentation, and using CI tools to enforce best practices, you can help new developers contribute effectively and confidently.
